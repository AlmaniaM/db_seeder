# db_seeder - Creation of Dummy Data in a Variety of Database Brands.

## 1. Introduction

## 2. Data Model

The underlying data model is quite simple and is shown here in the relational version. 
The 5 database tables CITY, COMPANY, COUNTRY, COUNTRY_STATE, and TIMEZONE form a simple hierarchical structure and are therefore connected in the relational model via corresponding foreign keys.  

The abbreviations in the following illustration (created with Toad Data Modeler) mean:

- (AK1) - alternate key (unique key)
- FK    - foreign key
- NN    - not null
- PK    - primary key
